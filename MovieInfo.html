<p>The basic premise here does sounds seem rather ridiculous–a man who uses humor and imagination to shield his son from the horrors of the holocaust while in a concentration camp! Well, first, most of the humor in the film occurs before the internment. This makes sense and allows the movie to be in good taste. The silly, and highly amusing, buffooneryof Benigni works quite well as he tries to capture the heart of a woman he keeps “bumping into”. These moments also abound with charm and seem rather reminiscent of the work of Chaplin–lots of physical humor and charm.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
The second half of the movie does indeed take place in a prison camp. Occasionally, there are some mildly humorous moments but the goal was not a cheap laugh but were desperate attempts to convince the child that he should not give up hope. Despite the ludicrousness of the plot at this point (hiding a little boy in a men’s dormitory in a prison camp), the way they explain it works out perfectly and should not offend or diminish from the horrors that were the holocaust.

This film, although VERY cleverly written, is carried by Benigni’s marvelous acting. Life Is Beautiful manages to walk the extremely thin line between humor, fantasy, and tragedy.Its a cinema masterwork of the nineties. Beautifully scored, photographed, directed and acted, it manages to make you laugh without being ridiculous, it manages to make you cry without being corny. Benigni’s rightly deserved the Oscar for Best Actor for all his charm, enthusiasm and magnetism.

Dont Miss it!</span></p>
